Very nice, thx

@pndurette

Thanks for this!
I noticed in a project I'm working on, the file .factorypath gets also auto-build (by VS Code, but seems to be an Eclipse thing as well)

I thought VSCode doesn't create files. Let me check and I will change the file accordingly. Thanks a lot for the suggestion.

Could possibly be maven as well—
(I work with this project but not with the Java portion specifically)

Can you can add pom.xml.bak ? Sort plugins makes a backup of the pom file

.fatctorpath is a result of Eclipse. So I added it to the Eclipse section.

I added the pom.xml.bak too. Thank you!

Useful gist +1

You may add the following as well -

Visual Studio Code
##############################
.vscode/

Apparently VSCode produces pretty much the same files as Eclipse.
It might be reasonable to adjust the comment from "Eclipse" to "Eclipse / VSCode".

Thanks a lot for the suggestion! I think they depend on the tools/extensions used with VSCode.

How about the work space files for VSCode?
*.code-workspace

Thanks a lot, @ckzgraphics! I personally believe checked in code should be IDE neutral. I don't like adding any file related to the .idea/ folder in the repository.

Yep, @dedunumax. Commented for better reach to the resource smiley
